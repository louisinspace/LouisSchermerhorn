<h2>Taking a Session to Relax in D&amp;D</h2>

<p>I discovered Dungeons &amp; Dragons about two years ago. I started by going to a local gaming store and paying $10 to drop in on a game hosted by one of the house DM’s once a week. I had figured I could get into this game in a major way, but because of the investment, learning curve, and need for at least 2–4 additional people I wasn’t ready to start embarking on my own. Of course, I discovered an incredible world of spells, classes, weapons and abilities that practically pried open my imagination. But the thing I was immediately drawn to about D&amp;D was the potential for unique “scenarios”; puzzles, escapes, riddles, dungeons, haunted descents, infiltrations, etc. When I started DMing my own game, I think the potential for interesting set pieces has drawn me more than any other aspect of the game.</p>
<p>So far in the long-term story session that I DM, the players have had to navigate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The investigation of a mysterious series of attacks</li>
<li>A mutiny against a tyrannical pirate captain</li>
<li>A race through a giant forge to activate a colossus</li>
</ul>
<p>I consider these “set pieces” to have been really strong anchor points between fairly typical sessions of combat and social interaction, loosely held together by a macro plot. And yet the last session we ran, a few weeks ago, felt among the most rewarding, creative, and imaginatively compelling. The best way to describe it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs host a grand opening for the tavern they renovated and redesigned</li>
</ul>
<p>No combat, no puzzle, low stakes, and no big bad. Maybe the concept for a session like this came at exactly the right time, but it seemed to be a big hit. I’ve been taking my players (loosely) through Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, and I found the section about inheriting and restoring a tavern to be a fun idea, if boringly executed. I didn’t think my players would get much fun out of rolling the dice to see how business did that day, and instead used it as an opportunity for everyone to bring a bit more creativity to the session.</p>
<p>In the months between sessions, I had the players choose an aspect of the tavern’s restoration they were going to take responsibility for, and then prepare as much or as little as they wanted to share with the other players about their vision for the tavern. I had mentioned the idea of a grand opening in the original prompt (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15N1NUEwjGdK9oNiwUIavrcgCUHqeMyAsTtFewG9gZHE/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">Linked here</a>, in a written narrative inspired by the methods of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkVdb9Yr8fc05_VbAVfskCA" target="blank">YouTuber Matt Colville</a>), but it was sort of meant to be a surprise that the session that followed this “homework” would see all the fruits of their thinking played out through the actual dynamics of a grand opening.</p>
<p>The session, in short, went fantastically. The players shared their work, took delight in each other’s imaginations, and then immediately set about “owning” that aspect of the tavern as the guests prepared to arrive. The bustle and energy of a party also allowed for me to do many things as a DM, looking to the longterm arc of Waterdeep: Dragon Heist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce characters that were going to be important later without forcing them to show up in a random encounter or dropping them unceremoniously into the plot later on.</li>
<li>Fill out the backstory of Waterdeep and the political intrigue the characters were going to be getting more involved in.</li>
<li>Giving the characters a stake in the city, making them care about the inhabitants and having something to lose if things go wrong.</li>
<li>As the concept of heists get more fleshed out in our forthcoming session, giving them a dry run through a social event where they <em>don’t</em> have an ulterior motive felt like an important neutral starting zone</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn’t have been happier with the results of the session, and I think the players got a kick out of it too. I think I’ll look to more opportunities for the “scenarios” I throw at players to be about relaxing, learning or expressing themselves creatively.</p>
