<h2>The Lack of Power Fantasy in Resident Evil 2</h2>

<p>I don’t watch horror movies. I know I can’t handle the stress and anxiety. But I’m one of those people who HAS to know the twist, the great big secret at the heart of the movie, or the horrifying turn that awaits the main characters. While I have this flirtatious relationship with the horror movie genre, I have stayed away from the genre in the video game world like it’s actual poison. I haven’t really ever stopped to consider why I never bothered to watch a YouTube video of the gameplay, or read a summary of the game’s story and ending. To be honest, I think this was a mix of fear and a perceived lack of quality from the horror corner of the video game world. I don’t often hear people talk about horror video games the way people talk about <em>Hereditary, The Blair Witch Project</em> or <em>The Babadook</em>.</p>
<p>That changed two years ago with the release of <em>Resident Evil 7</em>, which was hailed as a return to form for the series while being truly terrifying. The talk around this game was so good that I just had to look into it — is there enough adventure/puzzle genre there for me to be interested? You play as a guy named Ethan who goes to an ramshackle house deep in the bayou of Louisiana because he received a distressing message from his wife, who had been missing for 3 years. The gameplay involves moving around this puzzle box of a mansion, finding secret doors and keys, all while avoiding the horrifying “family” that lives there. It only took a few minutes of gameplay videos for me to realize that I could not handle this game. It looked gross, scary, disturbing — all the things that would make my play experience actually unpleasant. That they released a VR version for someone to take that extra immersive step makes me nauseous even thinking about it.</p>
<p>And then last month, Capcom released a remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. The original game from 1998 was considered possibly the best in the series and among the best games ever made. It hasn’t been on my radar (especially when I was 7 years old), but there were a lot of folks in 2019 who were looking forward to revisiting this classic with a modern approach to the gameplay. My interest was piqued again. I started reading the reviews, watching the videos. Slowly I thought “I can handle this.” I came upon <a href="https://youtu.be/oNbz2KQngv8" target="_blank">videos of Mr. X</a> and thought “Goddamn that is terrifying” followed again closely by “I can handle this.”</p>
<p>What I found in that game was, to put it simply, sublime. The mashup of 1998-era puzzles and level design with 2019 physics, lighting and sound was fresh, fun, and constantly engaging. Counter to the experience I’ve had with <em>BOTW</em> and <em>RDR2</em>, I experienced that video-gamey rush of wanting to find every item, open every door, become a true master of this game. When it was over, I immediately started a new file to play the game with the second character. The <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake is an excellent game and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>So how did I do with my aversion to horror? In short, <em>RE2</em> is not that scary. It toes a line, especially in its later half, between horror and action that I found totally manageable.</p>
<p>But the more I thought about it, I came to a more nuanced understanding of that idea. Unlike almost every other video game I enjoy playing, RE2 does not provide a power fantasy. The core of the game lies in the feeling that the odds are stacked against you. The parts of this game that provided the most fun were the sequences in and around the police station. I have 9 bullets, I have a key to a door on the other side of the station, and to get there I know there are a dozen zombies and a few horrifying lickers that I have to get past. Plus Mr. X is stalking me. I know because I can hear him. But I can’t tell exactly if he’s on the floor above me, or coming up the stairs from the floor beneath me. In moments like these, I’m filled with the same jolt of adrenaline that brought me to buying the game in the first place: “I can do this.” The fantasy of a game like this is not that you are powerful, but that you are average and can prevail anyway.</p>
<p>After finishing the game, I turned my eyes back toward <em>Resident Evil 7</em>. I had conquered one challenge, maybe I’m ready to move up. I came back to those gameplay videos. And I was filled once again with a horrible sense of dread and anxiety. I didn’t think I could handle this game. My brother bought it and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/spuckler296" target="blank">started streaming it on Twitch</a>, and I talked to him as he navigated the game’s gruesome opening 60 minutes. And I realized that something that was specifically turning me off about <em>RE7</em> is how that power imbalance had been skewed so far against the player that it was almost true helplessness. The little control you are given in those first few minutes is to walk predetermined steps until a jump-scare moves the story forward. There were scripted moments in that part where you can’t do anything but watch as awful things happen to your character.</p>
<p>To horror fans, this might be exactly what they’re looking for. And my understanding is that <em>RE7</em> becomes more like <em>RE2</em> after those first few hours. But for a newcomer to the Resident Evil franchise and the horror genre at large, I think I’m looking for a weakness fantasy that relies on a starvation of resources, and not true helplessness. I can’t even imagine going through that in VR.</p>
