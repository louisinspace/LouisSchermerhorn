<h2>In Breath of the Wild, I Don’t Want to Know What’s Out There</h2>

<p>This post contains mild spoilers for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>.</p>
<p>It’s February 2019 and I still haven’t finished <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. Grab a release calendar and you’ll realize that means I’ve only had 4 months to “complete” what <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369">many reviews pegged as a 70 hour game</a>, at least. To an outside viewer and probably a lot of you familiar with the game, this makes sense: the game came out just before the holidays. Time to sit and engage with a single player-game meant to be played in solitude can be scarce. And I spent most of January outside of the country on my honeymoon (the wedding was just before the release of the game, thank goodness). So I’m still playing this game, nowhere near completion, and yet I’ve been telling everybody this is possibly my favorite game of all time.</p>
<p>I think I’m excitedly sharing this reaction to the game because it has captured a feeling in me that I only discovered for the first time almost two years ago in Nintendo’s <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</i> in 2017. I came upon this feeling very early, after the game frees you from the land mass where it will take hours to train you in the game’s various systems and gameplay mechanics. There’s a moment where a character takes out your map, marks a spot on it that feels hundreds of miles away, says “go here” and then effectively pushes you out into the wild. This common gameplay freedom is referred to as the “open world”, and I tend to see game designers celebrate it because it offers the player far more choice than a typical linear level design. But the feeling I got from leaving the plateau and taking my first steps in Hyrule was new to me. I don’t ever recall this swelling of excitement and adrenaline when venturing out into the worlds of <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, <i>Watch Dogs</i>, <i>Skyrim</i> or even the original <i>Red Dead Redemption</i>. And the best way I could describe this feeling is “I don’t want to see everything in this world.”</p>
<p>It’s paradoxical to how I think game developers want us to engage with their spaces. There are secrets, upgrades, collectibles, achievements, side quests and more hidden throughout their massive open world games. Why put them there if not for players to see them? And yet as I played <i>Breath of the Wild</i>, finding better armor and weapons, taming a horse I liked to ride, getting very good at cooking, I grew apprehensive about the moment not when I would reach the end of the game, but when I had seen all of the world. After hours and hours, my circuitous route around Hyrule had left the central north area untouched. I started avoiding it, dreading the moment my map would be 100% filled in. I even averted my gaze from that direction when I was standing in high points that had views of the entire northern part of the map.</p>
<p>Then one afternoon, before heading towards the final confrontation of the game, I decided it was time to finally see the rest of the world. As I brought Link over to the center northern part of the map, I felt an odd melancholy. A bittersweet mixture of excitement and sadness for the end of my adventure. I wondered what kind of biome it would be. I had already visited snowy peaks, a desert, a lake, a volcano, a beach, and everything in between. When you approach this space from the south west, this is what you see: a giant island topped with a shrouded forest, next to a smaller island with a single tree. These folks know how to design space. I won’t reveal any answers (or further mysteries?) that lie on that island or in the forest, but suffice it to say it was a worthy environment to be my exploration finale to the game before the actual story finale.</p>

<p>While playing <i>Breath of the Wild</i> I considered it the best Zelda game I had ever played. And this had some competition. I loved 2003’s <i>Wind Waker</i>. I played it multiple times through when it first came out and played it again when it was re-released in HD on the Wii U. I had liked the 3D Zelda games that came since, but my favorite apart from Wind Waker had been 2013’s <i>A Link Between Worlds</i>. I found that game brilliant — its systems and secrets and world fit together like clockwork, and I was happy to get back in there and find everything it had to offer. I beat the game, collected everything, then started over and 100%-ed everything again. I spent my time playing <i>Breath of the Wild</i> looking forward to this experience. After reading this, it might not surprise you to learn that since I beat <i>Breath of the Wild</i>’s new chapter released at the end of 2017, I haven’t gone farther than hour 3 in a new save file.</p>
<p>Once a month I start it up again, hoping that it takes hold of me as it did in 2017. The game is fun, the puzzles are clever, and the world looks and sounds beautiful. But the spirit of adventure has left. Maybe with a few more years that mystery will come back.</p>
<p>But in 2019 I have <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. I’ll write more about this game’s epic commitment to immersion and mysterious wide open world separately. For now, it’s nice to have the spirit of adventure back.</p>
