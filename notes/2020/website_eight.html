<p>I have been spending most of today reading about the various ways to implement a blog again. Frankly, it’s been a frustrating and humbling experience. I’m in way over my head, reading about a bunch of terms I’ve never heard of or functionality that seems too advanced for me.</p>
<p>It seems curious that such a simple feature could be laden with so much technical complexity. Why does this blog content seem to need its own server? Why can’t HTML tags smartly sort and index content that is mostly words? As I sift through everything, I have to remind myself, again, of the features I was looking for.</p>
<p>I want my blog to be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each post should have a title, a date and written content.</li>
	<li>I thought I wanted each post to have tags. That way users could quickly see all my tagged posts about D&D, or this website.</li>
	<li>I don’t need any login functionality, or the ability for users to leave comments.</li>
	<li>I want the blog to work with RSS feed readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I sift through everything, I find myself wondering if I should start with what I clearly know is the “wrong” way, and work backwards to making things more advanced as the site grows. As in, I think I could manually create all the HTML that would make features like the above work, but I had thought there was some way to automate this easily. I suppose it’s not that easy.</p>
<p>I just wonder, if I start doing everything manually, will I create a site that actually disincentivizes me from updating it?</p>
