<h2>What have I gotten into?</h2>
<h4 class="posted">Written <time datetime="2020-05-20">May 20, 2020</time></h4>
<h4 class="tag_web"><a href="../notes_web.html">Website</a></h4>
<p>I've decided to take a crack at creating my own website, from scratch. I know the very basics of HTML and CSS based on classes I&#x27;ve taken in college and on-the-job learning from my career in digital marketing. With these skills plus Google, my goal is to build a state-of-the-art personal website.</p>
<p>By &quot;from scratch&quot; I mean &quot;without the aid of a website-building service.&quot; In this category I include companies like Squarespace and Wix. I want to have ultimate customizability and I want to learn, when I find myself unable to do something, why that is. As the web evolves and hardware evolves, I want to keep this site updated with the essential building blocks of code. What this does allow for is the help of &quot;tools&quot; such as Github, design software, coding software and, of course, YouTube tutorials.</p>
<p>Yesterday I typed my first code into an HTML and CSS file created by BBEdit. This was pretty simple, but of course I have nothing right now. The site looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="blogimage" src="../../img/website_one.png"></p>
<p>But that&#x27;s ok. I just want to start to get a feel for the tools that I&#x27;ll be using. From there, I made a Github account and started learning about repositories and branches. I can see how that&#x27;s extremely helpful for collaborative development, but still not clear to me if that&#x27;s how I should be using my site. The GitHub Pages feature seems like a simpler way of keeping my eye on a &quot;live&quot; version of the site. I don&#x27;t currently think it violates my rule about staying away from website-building services.</p>
<p>Today, I have a clearer picture of what I want to use the website for. And in the back of my head, I think I&#x27;ve known that&#x27;s where I needed to start anyway. What will people be able to find on the site?</p>
<p>Currently, I see a hierarchy like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Work
	<ul>
	<li>Career, experience and skillset summary</li>
	<li>SpotCo blog posts</li>
	<li>Website development blog posts</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>Play
	<ul>
	<li>Blog posts about video games</li>
	<li>D&amp;D campaign diaries</li>
	<li>Louis In Space Podcast</li>
	<li>Here There Be Dragons Podcast</li>
	<li>Other idle blog posts and creative endeavors</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>About Me
	<ul>
	<li>A more personalized bio.</li>
	<li>A timeline? (Thinking about a fun interactive way of visualizing my career)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>As this content becomes clearer, that&#x27;s the reason I started writing this blog post. I think I should keep this up. Would be fun to look back when this is &quot;done&quot; or at least launched!</p>
