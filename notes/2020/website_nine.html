<h2>Manually adding blog posts<h2>

<p>Well, I have spent this morning adding each of my written posts as individual pages, and then as excerpts on the homepage that link directly to these posts. I know this is the wrong way to do this, but I have to start somewhere and if this teaches me something the hard way, so be it.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't have enough written content yet for this to be an overwhelming task. And at some point, I was going to have to convert all these words into HTML anyway. I'm now seeing how something like Markdown could be useful. Maybe I'll learn that when the site is live. Speaking of converting into HTML, I've been writing these draft blog posts in <a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="blank">Notion</a>. This makes it a little easier to export as an HTML file and remove superfluous tags, but I'm sure there's an easier way.</p>
<p>This exercise has allowed me to take another look at my original vision for the structure of the site, and the way it's coming out now. I think where I've got to is much simpler (and probably more reflective of how often I'll actually update the site). But just so it's written out somewhere, this is the current outline for the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Home.</b> Users can see the latest updates in an updating feed.</li>
<li><b>Work.</b> Where users can read a summary of my career to date, link to my LinkedIn and download my resume.</li>
<li><b>Play.</b> I can write a summary of my various hobbies and link to certain blog posts.</li>
<li><b>Podcasts.</b> An overview of my two podcasts. This page is basically done now.</li>
<li><b>About.</b> A summary of me and links to my social profiles.</li>
</ul>
