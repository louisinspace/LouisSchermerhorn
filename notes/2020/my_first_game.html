<h2>My first game (kinda)</h2>
<h4 class="posted">Written <time datetime="2020-07-01">July 1, 2020</time></h4>
<h4 class="tag_creative"><a href="../notes_creative.html">Creative</a></h4>
<p>In the Spring of 2017 I was feeling on top of the world. I was approaching 2 years at my NYC job in Broadway advertising, and I had just been promoted. I decide to satiate a curiosity I'd had for most of my life and enroll in a game development course at <a href="https://playcrafting.com/" target="blank">Playcrafting in NYC</a>. Their website and marketing materials were so user-friendly and they seemed to have a genuine enthusiasm about helping more people learn about game development.</p>
<p>I've had a <a href="small_stint_in_filmmaking.html">fascination with production on big creative projects</a> for a while, but only recently was I learning more about game development and the vast world of art, science and problem-solving that lay behind it. I had taught myself how to use editors like Final Cut Pro and Photoshop, maybe there was an approachable way to learn how to do something in video games? It turns out there is a perfect answer to this question, and that is the game-engine Unity.  Naturally, Playcrafting offered an introductory course to learning how to use Unity.
<p>The course was 8 weeks long, with two evening classes a week and homework assignments. My instructor was a guy named Kevin Harper, with a teaching assistant (I think that was his title) named Rob Canciello. I had a great experience, learning about 3D graphics, 2D graphics, UI elements and all sorts of stuff. One of the places that I want to learn way more about is animation.</p>
<p>Anyway, for our final projects, we were tasked with making a game. I remember how much they stressed during the early phases to keep our scope extremely minimal. I understood this, but I also wanted to make something that excited me creatively. I came up with this idea for a UFO Abduction game. You can see <a href="../../files/ufo_game/index.html" target="blank">the document that I made to pitch the idea here</a>.</p>
<p>The game perspective would be a 2D "dollhouse" view into a multi-floor house. You would control a UFO that moves horizontally on a fixed plane above the house, with a tractor beam that can lift physical objects underneath it. Your goal, as the UFO, was to manipulate the objects in the house such that your target makes it into an open space so that you could float them up into the ship and abduct them.</p>
<p>So, naturally, this idea was way too ambitious to set me up for a successful final project. <a href="https://twitter.com/louisinspace/status/872223892722642944?s=20" target="blank">And I struggled a lot.</a> I spent two full weekends on this game and wound up with something that was not broken, even if it really didn't look anything like what I had pictured. </p>
<p>If you want to try the demo that I made for class, <a href="../../files/ufo_game/abduction.zip" target="blank">you can download it here</a>. It runs on Macs. I hope it doesn't break your computer.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, my final presentation went great. Even though I thought what I had was extremely janky, it was enough to communicate my vision for what the game would actually be like. The class and my instructor liked the concept and told me that I should finish it. I still haven't, but someday I will!</p>
