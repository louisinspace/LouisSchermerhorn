<h2>My small stint in filmmaking</h2>

<p>I have always been fascinated by the stories of how entertainment gets made and sold. I remember watching the behind-the-scenes videos that preceded the Star Wars Special Edition VHS releases and being mesmerized. These people were artists, problem-solvers, engineers. And they were playing, actually *playing!* with miniatures and models and rigs. It appeared to be more fun than watching the movies. There is probably a parallel universe where this inspired me to pursue a career in special effects. Instead I was drawn more to the theatre and live performance, and found new passions there.</p>
<p>I did indulge this fascination when I was a kid by making stop-motion movies with LEGO. I had always loved building LEGO sets, and in the early 2000's I discovered a huge community of filmmakers making cool stuff. I remember the first time I saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLvSpP1MEUM" target="blank">fan-made trailer for Star Wars: Episode III</a> that got me so excited for the movie (this was before the actual title for Revenge of the Sith had even been announced). I started making little LEGO movies in the universes of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. My problem was ambition. I came up with these ideas for epic stories and expansions of the universes, and of course would burn out or move on quickly.</p>
<p>I only finished one of these films, when I scaled my ambition down to my production capability. I made this over a few days in our old kitchen in New Jersey. Our chairs were designed to resemble thick pieces of wood put together into furniture, and at LEGO-scale I thought they would work as trees.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the software I was using at the time apparently couldn't export the files in a commonly used format. So I couldn't upload the movie directly to Facebook or YouTube. When I was in high school I had the idea to screen-record the file on an old computer and upload it to Facebook, which I figured was never going away. I've now downloaded it from there and uploaded to YouTube. It's a crappy way to watch the film but I'm very thankful that I have even this.</p>
