<h2>Getting on GitHub<h2>
<h4 class="posted">Written <time datetime="2020-06-26">June 26, 2020</time></h4>
<h4 class="tag_web"><a href="../notes_web.html">Website</a></h4>
<p>Today, I decided it was time to put my website on GitHub. It's not ready to go live yet (still need to finish the 'work' page), but I started worrying about having a reliable backup for the work I've done so far. GitHub seemed like a perfect solution to that.</p>
<p>A few YouTube videos later, I have a new project and repository where the whole site is hosted. All the links are broken because I wrote them in a sloppy way, but that's totally fixable. I'm using the GitHub Desktop application on Mac, and it has made things really simple. Now edits I make to the files on my computer are easily reconciled with the versions that are currently on GitHub.</p>
<p>This has also allowed me to see what the site looks like on devices other than my laptop. It looks ok on iPad, and not great on my iPhone! It looks like everything I've been doing to make the site responsive to the browser window size isn't working on the iPhone. That's a surprise, but probably also easily addressed (I hope...).</p>
