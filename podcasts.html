<h1>Podcasts</h1>
<p>I have started two podcasts. I started them for <a href="file:///Users/lschermerhorn/Desktop/Website/blog_web.html">similar reasons to making this website</a>: to learn new skills, and to find new ways of expressing myself and connecting with people.</p>

<h2>Louis in Space</h2>
<p></b>This podcast was my first foray into articulating my opinions and experiences with video games. I thought it would be interesting to combine my perspective as a hobbyist with others who would play video games that I recommended for them. As you can see from the latest episodes, it's turned into a catch-all audio feed of any kind of conversation that I think would be fun to record and share with friends. </p>

<p>Thank you to my friend Josie Brechner, who designed this sensationally cool graphic and the theme song. I love this design. You can check out her music and audio work <a href="https://visageraudio.com/" target="blank">here.</a></p>

<h2>Here There Be Dragons</h2>
<p>My wife and I started this podcast to talk about the TV show *Black Sails*, which aired on Starz from 2014-2017. Chelsea and I had been talking about the idea of starting a podcast together, and this opportunity presented itself when she told me about this TV show. We were enthralled by this show. Between the smart and sensitive acting, simple effective storytelling, and broad epic themes, we fell in love with the material in a deeper way than usual. Combined with the low viewership and awareness of the show, it became a great topic for podcast discussion. And another excuse to convince our friends to get into the show.</p>
<p>Alas, we only made it through the first two seasons before we fell off the habit. Between Chelsea's grad school and our wedding, this became the commitment that we let go of. But that was years ago, and now we are out of excuses. Some day, we will finish Seasons 3 and 4, which are excellent!</p>
