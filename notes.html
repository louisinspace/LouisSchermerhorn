<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Welcome to the organizing structure for my random opinions and journal entries. I don't intend to keep this regularly updated, but every so often I have an experience that I think is worth documenting. Not just what happened, but what I thought about it, how I felt. I do this mostly for myself. The hope is that there are some of you out there who are like me (or perhaps nothing like me) who find something nice in my writing about various topics.</p>
<p>I like playing video games, watching movies, seeing theatre, working on random creative projects and thinking about technology. You might find some thoughts related to those topics in the list below.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by the stories of how entertainment gets made and sold. I remember watching the behind-the-scenes videos that preceded the Star Wars Special Edition VHS releases and being mesmerized. These people were artists, problem-solvers, engineers. And they were playing, actually *playing!* with miniatures and models and rigs. It appeared to be more fun than watching the movies. There is probably a parallel universe where this inspired me to pursue a career in special effects. Instead I was drawn more to the theatre and live performance, and found new passions there...

<p>Well, I have spent this morning adding each of my written posts as individual pages, and then as excerpts on the homepage that link directly to these posts. I know this is the wrong way to do this, but I have to start somewhere and if this teaches me something the hard way, so be it... (Read More)</p></a>

<p>I have been spending most of today reading about the various ways to implement a blog again. Frankly, it’s been a frustrating and humbling experience. I’m in way over my head, reading about a bunch of terms I’ve never heard of or functionality that seems too advanced for me... (Read More)</p></a>

<p>Now that I have the mobile responsiveness all set, it seems I'm on to the task of actually building out each page.</p>
<p>For the past two days I've been focusing on the podcasts page. Right now, I want this to be a page where you can learn that I have made podcasts, read more about them, see the artwork, and link out to listen to them in Apple Podcasts... (Read More)</p></a>
